# T-REX
> Transfer - Ranked EXploration

This repo contains the code for T-REX, a journey planning algorithm I developed during my master thesis.
The underlying code base is taken from [FLASH-TB](https://github.com/TransitRouting/FLASH-TB), which is based on [ULTRA](https://github.com/kit-algo/ULTRA).
